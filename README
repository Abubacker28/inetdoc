# http://www.inetdoc.net source code repository
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This website is dedicated to internetworking documentation with FOSS.

It contains articles, guides, labs and presentations which can be used as
teaching or self learning material

As the documents have to be maintained over years, static web pages are the
most suitable way to publish them

DocBook XML source files are processed through XSL stylesheets
(http://wiki.docbook.org/topic/DocBookXslStylesheets) with libxslt tools
(http://xmlsoft.org/xslt/).

Customized stylesheets in this repository are developped for both XHTML and PDF
rendering.

FOP (http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/) is used to generate the PDF printable
versions of the documents.

Finally, nanoblogger (http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net/) is used as the web
publishing framework.

This repository does not contain real code ;) It's only a collection of
makefiles, and XML documents.
